                <h1>Rowan Atkinson</h1>
                <p>Rowan Sebastian Atkinson CBE (born 6 January 1955) is an English actor,
                    comedian and writer. He is best known for his work on the sitcoms 
                    Blackadder (1983–1989) and Mr. Bean (1990–1995). Atkinson first came 
                    to prominence in the BBC's sketch comedy show Not the Nine O'Clock News (1979–1982),
                    receiving the 1981 BAFTA for Best Entertainment Performance, and via his 
                    participation in The Secret Policeman's Ball (1979). His other work includes 
                    the James Bond film Never Say Never Again (1983), playing a bumbling vicar in 
                    Four Weddings and a Funeral (1994), voicing the red-billed hornbill Zazu in 
                    The Lion King (1994), and playing jewellery salesman Rufus in Love Actually (2003). 
                    Atkinson was listed in The Observer as one of the 50 funniest actors in British 
                    comedy in 2007,[3] and among the top 50 comedians ever, in a 2005 poll of 
                    fellow comedians.</p>
                <p>Atkinson was born in Consett, County Durham, England, on 6 January 1955. 
                    The youngest of four brothers, his parents were Eric Atkinson, a farmer and 
                    company director, and Ella May (née Bainbridge), who married on 29 June 1945. 
                    Atkinson was brought up Anglican, and was educated at Durham Choristers School, 
                    a preparatory school. After receiving top-grades in science A levels, he secured a 
                    place at Newcastle University, where he received a degree in Electrical and Electronic Engineering. 
                    In 1975, he continued for the degree of MSc in Electrical Engineering at 
                    The Queen's College, Oxford, the same college where his father matriculated in 1935, 
                    and which made Atkinson an Honorary Fellow in 2006. His MSc thesis, published in 1978, 
                    considered the application of self-tuning control. Atkinson briefly embarked in doctoral 
                    work before devoting his full attention to acting.
